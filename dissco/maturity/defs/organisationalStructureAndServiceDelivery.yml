name: Organisational structure and service delivery
questions:
  Organisational Structure:
    - >-
      In my organisation, it is clear which teams and/or individuals are responsible for delivering
      digitisation, data mobilisation or other aspects of the DiSSCo digital transformation

  Resourcing:
    - >-
      In my organisation, we have sufficient human and other resources available (including
      outsourced / contracted resources) to deliver our strategic aims for digitisation and digital
      transformation

  Infrastructure, tools and support:
    - >-
      In my organisation, we have the right general technological infrastructure and tools available
      to do our work (e.g. Wi-Fi, data storage, remote working tools)
    - >-
      In my organisation, we have the right specialist technological infrastructure and tools
      available to do our work (e.g. imaging and laboratory equipment, collections management
      system)
    - >-
      In my organisation, our use of general and specialist technological infrastructure and tools
      is appropriately supported (e.g. by an internal or external helpdesk, technology team and/or
      lab management team)

  Digitisation:
    - >-
      In my organisation, we understand the digitisation workflows required to digitise the objects
      in our collections
    - >-
      In my organisation, our collections have been or are being digitised at a large scale (even if
      we have a long way still to go)

  Digital by default:
    - >-
      In my organisation, key collections management processes such as acquisitions and loans are
      supported by digital services (e.g. a centralised process and/or team for imaging
      acquisitions)
    - >-
      In my organisation, collections processes and access are ‘digital first’ or digital by default
      i.e. people discover our collections online, and can request additional digital services such
      as imaging and analyses if they prefer this to accessing the physical collections

  Digitisation 'on demand'/as a service:
    - >-
      My organisation offers digitisation (data capture of key fields and 2D imaging of key angles)
      as a service/ on demand with defined service levels (e.g. defined timeframe for a response,
      defined cost or charging framework if relevant)
    - >-
      My organisation offers enhanced digitisation (e.g. additional 2D images, 3D imaging, chemical
      or molecular analyses) as a service / on demand with defined service levels (e.g. defined
      timeframe for response, defined cost or charging framework if relevant)
