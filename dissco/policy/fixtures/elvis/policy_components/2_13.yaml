    question: >-
      Does your institution have a granular collection categorisation system, like that
      described in the SYNTHESYS+ collection categorisation schema?
    description: >-
      Collection description granularity should be based on the categorization presented in of the
      SYNTHESYS+ collection classification schema, to at least the lowest granularity (broadest
      categories). See here (https://twk.pm/3ax5evp2mm) for more information about the SYNTHESYS+
      collection classification schema. The SYNTHESYS+ classification scheme is used for the DiSSCo
      dashboard, which will be embedded into ELViS.
