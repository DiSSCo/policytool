    name: Acquisition of genetic resources and prior informed consent for their utilization
    question: Does your institution regulate the acquisition of genetic resources?
    description: >-
      Some countries regulate access to their genetic resources, in this case genetic resources need
      not only be legally collected, but certain uses require a prior informed consent by a
      competent authority of this country. Upon acquisition of a genetic resource by a
      museum/institution, the collector should be asked to provide information on the necessity of a
      prior informed consent or any mutually agreed terms he/she entered into.
