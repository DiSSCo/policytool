    description: >-
      An institutional policy that reflects national, EU or supranational (e.g. EU) regulations on
      Traditional knowledge related to genetic resources. Traditional knowledge refers to the
      knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities (IPLCs) related to
      genetic resources (e.g. Know-how, innovations, practices, medicines etc.) that are relevant
      for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. ‘User’ countries need to
      take measures to ensure that genetic resources used in their country were accessed in
      accordance with the ABS rules of the provider country (with prior informed consent obtained
      and mutually agreed terms established).
