    question: What specimen data standards do you use?
    order: 1
    description: >-
      Controlled metadata schemas/vocabularies used to describe specimen data, including images and
      level of digitisation. The Open Digital Specimen is at the core of the DiSSCo research
      infrastructure and its services, and will be based on TDWG data standards (e.g. ABCD, and
      Darwin core).

    name: Collection description granularity
    question: >-
      Does your institution have a granular collection categorisation system, like that
      described in the SYNTHESYS+ collection categorisation schema?
    order: 2
    description: >-
      Collection description granularity should be based on the categorization presented in of the
      SYNTHESYS+ collection classification schema, to at least the lowest granularity (broadest
      categories). See here (https://twk.pm/3ax5evp2mm) for more information about the SYNTHESYS+
      collection classification schema. The SYNTHESYS+ classification scheme is used for the DiSSCo
      dashboard, which will be embedded into ELViS.
