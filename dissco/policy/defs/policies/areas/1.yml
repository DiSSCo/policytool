      Guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital
      assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational
      systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention)
      because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the
      increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data. (from
