# Policy Tool Rough Designs

These rough (!) designs have been created in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

They all live in the same view so you can load them up all at once by loading the
designs.excalidraw file into excalidraw directly.

If you'd like to see what they look like, head [here](https://excalidraw.com/#json=weigqPVH2tawjfRpylGcs,ysdFWIzxSPtYUEGMDnUlFg).
Note that changes to the view at that link won't update the files in this directory!

Exported images are also provided in this directory for each page.
